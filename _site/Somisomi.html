Loyal fans of the soft serve continue to post on social media sites about the dessert, generating organic marketing that is relatable and real to outside consumers. Their target market gravitates towards experiences that they can share on social media; their fish cones are especially popular in online spaces since it is not the typical ice cream cone shape we normally see in shops.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somisomi believes in a strong commitment to culture, creativity, and consumer connection. As they continue to expand to many states in the US, they continue to reach their consumers, enabling them to create their perfect dessert. Somisomi&rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to offer more than just a dessert, but a shared experience, not just online, but with family and friends. Consumers are seeking out experiences that they can share with and Somisomi fills that need for uniqueness and individuality. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c34">Company</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Somisomi is a Korean dessert company that specializes in &ldquo;Ah-Boong&rdquo; treats, which are soft serve ice cream in a fish-shaped waffle cone or taiyaki-shaped cone. Guests have the opportunity to choose from a variety of unique flavors, fillings and toppings to decorate their treat. </span><span class="c9">A</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;taiyaki could be ordered by itself with filling for those who prefer that instead. Somisomi was founded in 2016 by Matt and Woori Kim. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Their start began in Koreatown, Los Angeles, California and quickly gained popularity within the community. This opened the chance to expand their company towards new opportunities. Somisomi is currently located in California, Texas, Nevada, and Washington, with over thirty-three locations and counting. Somisomi employees main task is to create and serve the customers&#39; choice of soft serve and fillings. Somisomi has its original location in </span><span class="c9">Koreatown</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;labeled as the &ldquo;Somisomi Lab Store&rdquo;, which &ldquo;provides exclusive access to unreleased flavors, innovative options, and freshly developed products straight from our research and development phase&rdquo; (Somisomi, 2024). This experimental store allows </span><span class="c9">Somisomi</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;to tweak their </span><span class="c9">product</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in order to appeal to their customers&rsquo; needs as best as they can. Somisomi offers franchising to those who are interested in delving into the soft serve space. This kind of business model allows for growth and expansion within the dessert industry, offering a new and competitive product in the market. Although this business model can be effective, each Somisomi is independently owned and operated, which can leave room for some inconsistencies. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">The Somisomi located at the Irvine Spectrum generated approximately $129,272 with 8 employees and had been in operation for six years so far (Buzzfile, 2025). Somisomi continues to reinvent and promote exciting products for their </span><span class="c16">loyalist</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;customers and aims to generate new fans to join and enjoy their treats. Since Somisomi is a relatively new company, they have more years to grow as an organization and touch the lives of their consumers. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Customer Base</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somisomi&rsquo;s customer base consists of dessert enthusiasts who are interested in a fun and refreshing treat. Since Somisomi offers a unique-looking treat, their customers mainly consist of those who are internet-savvy and partake in online trends. Those kinds of customers range from Gen Z and Millennials, though a mature audience can still enjoy the treat. The soft serve in the taiyaki cone offers a perfect picture to post, since they have a product that is different from the typical ice cream cone. Young children and their families are also fond of the cute fish design of the cone, which could generate some sales from those kinds of customers. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">In recent years, East Asian culture has been taking over America by storm with the popularization of Anime, K-pop, and aesthetic foods. Popular K-Pop groups such as BTS rose to fame during the same time as the beginning of Somisomi. Since groups like BTS were all over the media, such as Rolling Stone, Good Morning America, and Vogue, K-pop cemented its way in Western culture (Glasby, 2021). The rise of K-pop and other Korean trends catapulted SomiSomi into the mainstream, allowing them to capitalize on the success of trendy Korean products. Somisomi fulfills </span><span class="c16">Maslow&rsquo;s hierarchy of needs</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;in the social needs for its consumers due to the fact that this organization thrives on connectivity with other people. Somisomi knows that their customers thrive on social interaction through social gatherings or social media posts highlighting their trips. With this, they aim in promoting a strong community that can get together and share their love of the brand either in person or online. This customer base does not just buy a treat; they are engaging in a special moment, whether it be taking a picture and tagging friends or simply spending time with one another. Although soft serve is not a direct need, Somisomi&rsquo;s customers remain passionate about the brand and continue to buy dessert from them. Somisomi&rsquo;s strength lies in its capability to bring together flavor, self-expression, and community connection. </span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c34">Competition</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Some of </span><span class="c9">Somisomi&rsquo;s</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;competitors consist of a couple other soft serve companies such as</span><span class="c27">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Bumsan and Magpie, both of whose locations are also located in Los Angeles. These companies specialize in trendy desserts centered around online trends. Bumsan speciality is serving organic soft serve that is decorated in cereal cake cones, highlighting a social-media worthy post for many foodie eccentric individuals. Their choice in making their soft serve organic appeals to the health-conscious consumer market, making sure their desserts are of good quality and healthy for those wishing to fulfill their sweet tooth, without ruining their health goals. Bumsan might be considered a direct competitor against Somisomi since one of their locations is in Koreatown, also known as the birthplace of Somisomi. On the other hand, Magpie is a vegan-friendly soft serve company that perfected classic flavors like vanilla and chocolate. They are located in popular places like Silverlake and Highland Park, generating more trendy customers looking for a quick treat. Somisomi&rsquo;s products are not entirely vegan and are not organic, which these places succeed in offering. However, because of Somisomi&rsquo;s offers of producing interesting gimmicks with the fish-shaped cone&ndash;&rdquo;Ah-Boong,&rdquo; they definitely stand out in front of others who serve their soft serve in a plain cone or cup. </span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Somisomi continues to stay true to its cultural roots of being a traditional Korean treat that consists of flavors such as ube, matcha, and milk tea which draws people into its story as opposed to the basic, well-known story of American soft serve. American populations tend to drift towards new and trendy products, and with its origins being Korean&ndash;a big topic in today&rsquo;s market, many continue to be drawn to try them out. The social media appeal of Somisomi dominates the soft serve market since their treats are practically designed for an online post, generating likes and comments from others who might not know of Somisomi. Since Somisomi allows franchising, they are able to create more stores, generating more publicity and income compared to their competitors. Somisomi has a strong</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">social networ</span><span class="c16">k</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;that interacts with each other and the company, normally promoting and discussing all things Somisomi. Since Somisomi is a product that generates social interaction, they are able to have a strong competitive advantage against other soft serve companies because they know that their customers support and believe in Somisomi&rsquo;s vision for the future of soft serve treats. </span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">SWOT Analysis Matrix</span></p><table class="c52"><tr class="c56"><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c6">Strengths:</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_ndkcr2oug67h-0 start"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Unique product offering</span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">High-quality ingredients </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Cultural values </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Customization </span></li></ul></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c6">Weaknesses:</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_jfo6jzo8cup-0 start"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Limited variety compared to competitors when it comes to locations </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Seasonal desert</span></li></ul><p class="c35 c12 c42"><span class="c1"></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c38"><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c6">Opportunities:</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_vw8latgx7ttf-0 start"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expansion to reach more customers </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Potential collabs and partnerships </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Product expansion</span></li></ul><p class="c35 c12 c42"><span class="c1"></span></p></td><td class="c37" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c35"><span class="c6">Threats:</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_nj61e5uoflew-0 start"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Competition from other established ice cream shops </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Resign prices for quality ingredients </span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Economic downturns</span></li></ul></td></tr></table><p class="c19"><span class="c7">Strategies based on SWOT</span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_qbz9bulzgqu4-0 start" start="1"><li class="c19 c28 c42 li-bullet-0"><span class="c6">Minimize Weaknesses to Unlock Opportunities</span></li></ol><p class="c19 c42"><span class="c9">To address the seasonal weakness of Somisomi, it can expand its product line to include warm drinks, allowing it to attract more customers. By relying on </span><span class="c16">stimulus generalization</span><span class="c9">, the company can launch new products under the same brand, and customers will likely respond in a similar way. Somisomi already serves matcha flavored ice cream, and introducing a matcha latte for the cooler seasons would be a great correlation. Another product that can be introduced is a Korean-inspired coffee, for example, they can introduce a Banana Milk Latte, another flavor they already have for their ice cream. People of this Asian</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c16">subculture</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">will feel more connected and excited to try something familiar to them. Somisomi can also take a greater step and continue to attract other communities and release a Dulce de Leche inspired drink as well, one that can target the Hispanic subculture who grew up with this flavor. As for the concern among customers who are health conscious, so as to tend to their needs, the brand can also include healthier ice cream options or dairy-free flavors. </span></p><p class="c19 c29 c42"><span class="c9">Creating a loyalty program would help the company stand out from its competitors, offering unique deals and keeping customers engaged, even with the threat of rising prices in today&rsquo;s economy. The already loyal customers can become or attract more </span><span class="c16">practical loyalists</span><span class="c26">, </span><span class="c9">who </span><span class="c9">find these deals or offers to have good value for the price of what they get. It&rsquo;ll increase repeat purchases and reduce </span><span class="c16">opportunistic switchers</span><span class="c9">, </span><span class="c1">especially in a market crowded with ice cream alternatives. To continue increasing loyalty, the company can take advantage of its Instagram platform and encourage more interaction with customers. Aside from coming out with new flavors, they could also post polls online and allow customers to vote and share what kind of flavor they would love to try next. This would help to better understand what the customer wants and make them feel more valued for hearing out their suggestions. </span></p><ol class="c0 lst-kix_qbz9bulzgqu4-0" start="2"><li class="c39 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c26">Leverage Strengths</span><span class="c51">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">Somisomi is successful because of its visual marketing, and they must continue to use it to their advantage. Their </span><span class="c16">brand personality</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;is fun, trendy, and creative. The fish cone is the main event when posting on social media, therefore, the company can get creative and introduce limited edition cone shapes, for example, a heart-shaped cone for Valentine&#39;s Day. Anything that catches the eye and would make their photogenic customers want to share online on social media. &nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c39"><span class="c9">This directly ties to creating customer anticipation, allowing them to look forward to trying something fresh and new. A good example is the company brand </span><span class="c9">Crumbl</span><span class="c9">, which successfully puts out new cookie flavors every week. Somisomi can do the same with not just their flavors but their toppings, fillings, and cones. They can also take it one step forward and participate in collabs and partnerships to attract different markets and niches. For example, celebrities, anime, or anything in pop culture, something they haven&#39;t done before, or something that customers wouldn&#39;t expect. Leveraging these strengths helps improve the overall experience when customers visit SomiSomi, making it more meaningful.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c34">Marketing Goals and Objectives</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c19 c29"><span class="c9">In this fast-growing world where the interests and </span><span class="c16">motivations</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">of individuals are constantly changing, Somisomi has had a lot of objectives to target these unfulfilled needs in order to succeed in its marketing goals. Somisomi&#39;s primary Business Goal, as we mentioned before, is to increase </span><span class="c26">customer loyalty</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;and drive foot traffic to Somisomi locations. Throughout the duration of our research, advertisements of &ldquo;(Location) Opening Soon!&rdquo; or &ldquo;(Location) Now Open!&rdquo; filled the Somisomi website. From its first location opening in LA&rsquo;s Koreatown to now expanding to 5 U.S. states is a big leap, while also keeping value in its locations. Its method of </span><span class="c9">only</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;operating 21 locations throughout CA (at the time of this report) brings value and loyalty from customers willing to commute to </span><span class="c26">satisfy </span><span class="c1">their needs. On the other hand, their dedication in SomiSomi&rsquo;s management starting to open new locations in areas that are well populated will most absolutely help their business gain more recognition as to what they can do to fulfill customers&rsquo; sweet needs.</span></p><p class="c19 c29"><span class="c9">Seeking specific goods is the main focus for consumers of Somisomi, which lies within the factors that motivate all consumers&rsquo; shopping. There exists </span><span class="c16">seeking specific goods shopping</span><span class="c26">, </span><span class="c16">recreational shopping</span><span class="c9">, </span><span class="c16">activity-specific shopping</span><span class="c9">, and </span><span class="c16">demand-specific shopping</span><span class="c1">. Seeking specific goods involves recreation and focuses on enjoyment instead of necessity. Activity-specific shopping is a result of shopping while participating in events or activities, while demand-specific shopping is driven by the urgent needs of a consumer. As discussed during the lecture, these are motivations that help categorize shopping on a need basis and as a result, aids companies such as SomiSomi to create a clearer objective of how to target current and future customers. </span></p><p class="c19 c29"><span class="c9">With sweet desserts being a product that can fulfill all 4 of these areas of shopping, the market for ice cream is already a very competitive one. With Somisomi&rsquo;s first locations opening in Koreatown and Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, California, it has succeeded in targeting an economy of tourists visiting these popularized locations in search of a sweet treat. As a result, their objective has grown to be a bucket list for both tourists and locals to purchase Somisomi&rsquo;s products. Especially during &ldquo;the summertime where competition is stiff,&rdquo; as La Marco mentions in the article, &ldquo;Objectives for an Ice Cream Business.&rdquo; Somisomi has to find a way to stand out among the many ice cream options available to consumers and build upon the </span><span class="c16">incentives</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;that appeal to individuals&rsquo; cravings. As mentioned before, Somisomi creates further attraction for new and current customers with seasonal promotions or flavors. They recently introduced a Dulce de Leche ice cream flavor to engage Hispanic/Latino communities who grew up with this sweet, a Mexican caramel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of a need for attraction, Somisomi has been very </span><span class="c9">engaging on Social Media with all present and potential customers. They have a </span><span class="c26">KPI </span><span class="c1">to increase Instagram followers by 20% and achieve a 15% boost in monthly visits within 3 months. With its follower count landing at 100K at the time of this report being written, such a KPI will mean they hope to achieve a 20,000 increase in followers within 3 months. Especially with a higher increase in digital marketing and an increase in social media trends, Somisomi is determined to hop onto this train of interest. Additionally, SomiSomi&rsquo;s website tells us more KPI goals: Get 500 new loyalty members with a 10% increase in customer return rate in 6 months. KPI: 20% increase in Delivery sales with 100 positive reviews. Especially with the rise of delivery options after COVID-19 in 2020, there has been a rise in the need to enjoy meals, or in this case, sweets,from the comfort of your own home. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Segmentation Criteria</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">To efficiently identify its customer base, Somisomi uses a mix of demographic, geographic, behavioral, and psychographic segmentation. Demographically, Somisomi&rsquo;s products are for all ages and all genders, but the brand focuses more strongly on Gen Z and Millennials as its target customers. Young consumers between the ages of 15 and 35, who tend to be middle to upper class, are Somisomi&#39;s ideal customers.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Geographically, Somisomi places its stores in urban cities with high traffic to attract potential customers. In addition, the weather is also an important factor that Somisomi considers; they choose places with warm climates to suit their products, so that cold desserts can be enjoyed all year round.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Behaviorally, the brand attracts customers who are looking for a special dessert to celebrate or a sweet treat after meals. Many of these consumers are medium to regular customers who are drawn to trendy and aesthetically pleasing food.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c9">Psychographically, Somisomi&rsquo;s ideal consumers are trend-conscious individuals. They are trend-savvy and love trying out new food experiences. With our previous analysis on </span><span class="c26">Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs </span><span class="c1">effects in our customer base, we would like to note Somisomi&rsquo;s continuous target in individual&rsquo;s self esteem and self-actualization levels, helps create the perfect target profile in order continue to appeal to lifestyle consumers who value novelty and social media aesthetics.</span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Target Profile</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">An example of a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; customer target profile is similar to the segmentation: A busy urbanite who is young and very active on online platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube to share their everyday experiences. These individuals are knowledgeable in the internet space and value visual appeal, cultural relevance, and novelty. Since Somisomi appeals strongly to both Korean-Americans and a broader audience interested in Korean culture, they can profit from the K-pop, K-drama, and Korean food wave that is present in America. </span></p><p class="c11 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c7">Positioning</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c1">Somisomi&rsquo;s positioning strategy focuses on both product price and product quality. While providing a high-quality, customizable dessert experience, its differentiation lies in the exclusive offering of Ah-Boong, its signature creamy soft-serve ice cream served in freshly made fish-shaped taiyaki cones and fillings. Instead of competing exclusively on price or novelty, SomiSomi conveys a culturally rich experience that feels welcoming but on an elevated level. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c34">Literature Review on the Target </span><span class="c34">Segment</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">Gen Z refers to the demographic cohort born between 1997 and 2012. They are the first generation to grow up with the internet and digital technology from a young age, shaping their behaviors and attitudes. Millennials are characterized by their early adoption of technology, value for work-life balance, and a strong desire for authenticity and personalization. SomiSomi&rsquo;s target consumers are both Gen Z and Millennials, who share a history of economic turmoil and rapid technological change that has shaped their views of the world. Still, there are also clear differences in their attitudes, values, and behaviors. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on data from the &ldquo;</span><span class="c9 c32">GfK Consumer Life Global&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;report, Gen Z values &#8203;&#8203;creativity and curiosity more than older consumers, while Millennials tend to be more cautious about their spending because they have taken a greater financial hit during the pandemic. Gen Z is the most diverse generation in history. They value inclusivity and are more likely to support brands that represent a wide range of races, genders, and sexual orientations. Since they are a flexible generation, they tend to be less brand loyal than Millennials. They are willing to switch brands if they find a better product or deal. Moreover, social media trends, influencers, and peers are the elements that can significantly affect their purchasing decisions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millennials seek authenticity and personalization. They prefer brands that are transparent and offer personalized experiences. When looking for a new brand or product, they are more likely to be influenced by reviews and recommendations from experienced users. They do research and read reviews before making a purchase, so brand reputation is important to them. However, Millennials have more brand loyalty when they find a brand that fits their needs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">To attract both generations, Somisomi needs to consider tailored strategies based on the differences and commonalities of both customer groups. The products that appeal to target customers are the brand&rsquo;s strengths. But more than that, Somisomi can focus on actively promoting its image in various forms. For example, Gen Z prefers Instagram and TikTok, preferring short, humorous video content, while Millennials prefer informative posts on Facebook or X with eye-catching images. As these generations continue to shape the market, Somisomi needs to stay informed and adapt strategies accordingly.</span></p><p class="c19 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c7">Current State and Proposed Changes</span></p><p class="c19 c29"><span class="c9 c14">The ice-cream market is facing increased restraint because of the growing health focus amongst consumers who devour high-calorie ice cream. One hundred grams of ice cream includes 207 calories, making it an excessive-calorie food. As a result, the demand for vegan and organic ice cream is growing in the US market. Health-aware purchasers search for plant-based options, propelling the dairy-free and natural ice cream boom. This trend indicates a shift in the direction of sustainable and moral selections (PR Newswire, 2024). </span><span class="c1">Therefore, Somisomi may consider launching health-conscious options, such as dairy-free or low-sugar, to cater to the growing health-conscious consumer segment. This will also help the brand reach a wider audience of new customers. Furthermore, with environmental issues receiving more and more attention, switching to environmentally friendly product packaging is also a potential step to create a good impression on the public.</span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c34">Analysis of Marketing Mix- Four P&rsquo;s</span></p><table class="c52"><tr class="c21"><td class="c50" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Product:</span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_zdqc6cb3dzx-0 start"><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Korean soft-serve in taiyaki cones (Ah-Boong)<br></span></li><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Unique flavors like ube, matcha, and seasonal flavors that change every so often<br></span></li><li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Instagrammable design (cute fish-shaped cone)</span></li></ul></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Price:</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_rojdkysy1s9r-0 start"><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Affordable for a premium dessert</span></li><li class="c18 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Mid-range chains sell from</span></li></ul><p class="c35 c42"><span class="c1">&nbsp;$4-$10</span></p><p class="c13 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p></td></tr><tr class="c55"><td class="c50" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Place:</span></p><p class="c12 c15"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_b4j08vu2ilg4-0 start"><li class="c13 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Located in trendy, high-foot-traffic areas</span></li></ul><p class="c12 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_b4j08vu2ilg4-0"><li class="c13 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Expansion through franchising </span></li></ul><p class="c13 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_b4j08vu2ilg4-0"><li class="c13 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Warmer areas and cities</span></li></ul><p class="c13 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p></td><td class="c31" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span class="c6">Promotion:</span></p><p class="c15 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_bjgq5f8q94w0-0 start"><li class="c13 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Advertising heavily focused on Instagram &amp; Tik Tok</span></li></ul><p class="c13 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p><ul class="c0 lst-kix_bjgq5f8q94w0-0"><li class="c13 c28 li-bullet-0"><span class="c1">Word of mouth and influencer partnerships </span></li></ul><p class="c13 c12"><span class="c1"></span></p></td></tr></table><p class="c19"><span class="c6">Product</span></p><p class="c19 c29"><span class="c9">Somisomi is a dessert brand that specializes in serving soft serve ice cream, a service that many ice-cream shops fulfill as well. However, Somisomi ups its place in the market, allowing customers to customize their dessert by choosing a filling, toppings, and serving type of either its Ah-Boong cone or a traditional cup. These fillings and toppings consist of matcha, ube, oreo, nutella, red bean, and more. Most importantly, this brand&rsquo;s main product focus is the fish-shaped taiyaki, Ah-boong. Apart from their soft serve and taiyaki, they offer drinks known as &ldquo;Somi sips&rdquo;. They offer products that can cater to Gen Z and millennials. Gen Z is a generation that values individuality, which is something that Somisomi has successfully done. They have separated themselves from other dessert shops by offering a different style of soft serve. &nbsp;Millennials are more likely to shop in places where there is more </span><span class="c16">product involvement</span><span class="c9">. Such as being able to personalize their dessert.. Somisomi is the right place for them to customize each step of their dessert. This has been a successful outcome for Somisomi because their main strategy is prioritizing the consumers&#39; needs. SomiSomi aims to give its customers a positive experience with their customization, fun, family atmosphere, and unique options. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c26">Price</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">The pricing for Somisomi ranges from $3 to $10. Considering all the customizations that come with the soft serve, the pricing is affordable. Somisomi has been able to keep the </span><span class="c16">brand loyalty</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;from consumers because they offer high-quality desserts at an affordable price. To continue the loyalty of their customers, it could be beneficial to add a rewards program. By implementing a loyalty program, it would further encourage customers to continue visiting the establishment. </span></p><p class="c11 c28 c14 c53"><span class="c26">Place</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">When it comes to Somisomi&rsquo;s locations, they are usually located in high-traffic foot areas as noted in their 33 locations spread out throughout California, Washington, Texas, and Arizona. With more locations being built throughout these states, and a new location being brought to Colorado, its expansion is very strategic. The overall look of these locations consists of bright neon colors, with the main focus being a neon yellow. When looking at it from the outside, Somisomi has been able to successfully catch the attention of those passing by with the neon colors. While they have an eye-catching exterior, their interior needs to be modified. This is due to the fact that their target market is more attracted to places that they consider to be &ldquo;Instagrammable&rdquo;. A place that they can visit and take pictures to upload to social media. With small additions to their interior, they could bring in more customers by promoting the look of their place. </span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c6">Promotion</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9">The desert brand heavily relies on word of mouth, buzz marketing, and social media to promote itself. They use the combination of social media and word of mouth to generate a long line of customers out the door. </span><span class="c1 c14">In this case, Gen Z is a generation that enjoys watching fun and engaging content. It is something that Somisomi uses to their advantage by uploading fun and relatable content for consumers to engage with. They make content where they play a game or upload a video that relates to a current trend. Gen Z tends to pay more attention to brands that are able to keep up with trends and upload content that they feel connected to. Similarly, millennials tend to look for brands that are able to create personal relationships through social media engagement. Therefore, by creating content that aligns with Gen Z and millennials&#39; values, they are able to successfully bring in customers.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c9 c14">Moving on to word-of-mouth influence, Somisomi heavily relies on this area of marketing to grow its popularity. Consumers are more likely to buy a product if a friend or family member recommended it to them. This is because they have more trust and credibility than the marketing from the actual brand. The word-of-mouth influence also ties in with buzz marketing because the marketing is being done to create excitement and anticipation for the product. They are using family and friends to let others know about their new product or location. Through </span><span class="c16 c14">earned social media</span><span class="c26 c14">, </span><span class="c1 c14">previous customers are able to share their recommendations and experiences about Somisomi.

As their product evolves, refining its marketing mix can help Somisomi attract more customers. Some recommendations for Somisomi would be to expand flavor offerings, create bundle deals, expand to areas with high foot traffic, and use more social media engagement to promote. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A recommendation that would help Somisomi increase its customer engagement would be to expand its product line and offer more flavors. By introducing flavors that are trending in the market or in season, Somisomi would enhance its brand equity. Leading to more sales and attraction from consumers who keep up with trends. Another idea would be to offer co-branding with other companies that could lead to different flavor collaborations. Overall, creating a differentiation in the market would make SomiSomi stand out in relation to direct competitors who provide similar Korean-inspired desserts. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers tend to make judgments of food based on the scent, taste, and appearance. This is known as sensory marketing, and Somisomi could host events that are appealing to consumers that would allow them to sample new soft serve flavors. Oftentimes, consumers tend to buy things that are aesthetically pleasing, which means that something is appealing to the eye. Another idea for Somisomi would be to have different color cones and add vibrant colors that customers could choose from. Somisomi could form connections with consumers by hosting events and collaborating with other food experts on social media. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bundle deals when shopping are always appealing to consumers. Somisomi could implement bundle pricing strategies such as a family pack that allows customers to purchase multiple servings of different ice cream flavors at a discounted price. Another recommendation would be to implement psychological pricing, which is often seen at movie theaters, for example, $2.99 instead of $3. Over time, this would increase sales depending on how the pricing is for the different sizes. Analyzing the pricing in local dessert shops would help SomiSomi maintain a competitive advantage if they want to either raise prices or decrease them. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another recommendation would be for </span><span class="c9">Somisomi</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to focus on how their appearance stands out to consumers and how their culture is reflected in the eyes of the customer. For example, DutchBros employees are exceptionally friendly and embody the culture that the company is trying to reflect. Creating a positive customer experience for Somisomi would be important to make sure that the company sees growth and success in the long run. Somisomi is an independently owned and operated franchise that could continue growing if it maintains brand consistency, provides training for employees, and implements effective operational guidelines. By maintaining brand consistency and providing a guideline, Somisomi could make sure that each franchise follows the marketing, branding operation, and consistent customer experience. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somisomi should expand to different locations that have high foot traffic, such as college campuses, malls, tourist locations, and beachside areas. Pop-up shops in festivals or at local events would also make them stand out more. Although Somisomi&rsquo;s primary business model isn&rsquo;t related to having pop-up shops, these may help the brand attract more customers to expand its ice cream shop&rsquo;s reach and appeal. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing social media engagement using influencers and user-generated content would boost their reach to other consumers. Influencer marketing increases brand awareness and drives engagement to an organization, which could potentially boost sales and conversation around the ice cream that Somisomi provides. Expanding to wider audiences would allow Somisomi to enter new markets and have a competitive advantage. This would then allow Somisomi to implement new marketing strategies to cater to their diverse customer demographics. Collecting the data, feedback, and research from the collaborations with influencers would lead Somisomi to make new changes to understand customer preferences. Instagram, TikTok, and other social media platforms could be used to feature Somisomi&rsquo;s trending soft serve designs, plus flavors that could go viral. Somisomi is positioned online as a trendy food dessert. Another recommendation would be to add advertisements in local magazines, social media platforms, and food blogs. Collaborating with local artists, actors, or inspirational public figures could improve their brand image. By building their brand image, they could improve the perception that customers have of Somisomi, which will then lead to word-of-mouth. By Somisomi building their brand image, it would ultimately enhance customer loyalty, trust, and experience growth for the company. </span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c9">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somisomi is a growing ice cream franchise company that is becoming more trendy and captivating to consumers in various areas. By improving their marketing mix of product, price, place, and promotion, they can strengthen their company in the dessert industry. Offering more flavors, seasonal offers, and collaborations would be recommended for Somisomi to increase its customer engagement.

Relocating to high foot traffic areas could increase the customer audience and offer more customer demographics. Using different promotion methods would help Somisomi strengthen their brand image by collaborating with artists and using influencer marketing to promote their flavorful offerings of their ice cream. Overall, Somisomi is a brand that has a distinctive image in the market and would see more growth in the long run if it implements new marketing strategies.</span></p><p class="c19 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c12 c22"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19 c22 c12"><span class="c7"></span></p><p class="c19 c22"><span class="c34">References</span><span class="c26">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c49"><span class="c9">LaMarco, Nicole. &ldquo;Objectives for an Ice Cream Business.&rdquo; </span><span class="c9 c32">Chron, </span><span class="c1">Hearst Newspapers, 2025,</span></p><p class="c49 c29"><span class="c20 c9"><a class="c24" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://smallbusiness.chron.com/objectives-ice-cream-business-70538.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1747253683240886&amp;usg=AOvVaw32yHa35JQqvfbEcl7Hpgvo">Objectives for an Ice Cream Business</a></span></p><p class="c11 c12 c45 c42"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c11 c45 c42"><span class="c9">Buzzfile.
